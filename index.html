      <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> Is the framework I used to create this page.

    <h2 class="text-base font-semibold mb-2">Framework Installed:</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      In this lab, I used Tailwind CSS as my framework. I did not have to download or install anything
      for this lab as I utilized the CDN link for Tailwind CSS. I built the page within my index.html file and hosted it using GitHub Pages.

    <h2 class="text-base font-semibold mb-2">Difficulties Encountered</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">
      While creating this page I encountered some difficulties with the framework. Since it is my first time using Tailwind CSS,
      I had to spend some time researching it and understanding some of its functions. After spending some time researching and messing around I was able to create this page.
      Figuring out styling with the framework took some extra time as there is so many options with tailwind.
